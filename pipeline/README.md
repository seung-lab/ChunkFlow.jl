alignment/ should contain all aligned tif images, which shouldn't have applied any filter ( unless the znn was trained with that filter)

znn/ , watershed/ , and omnify/ contains the source code and/or binaries required to run. They all contain a data/ folder which contains the chunks  to be processed, this chunks are create by the python scrips in /scripts.

/trace contains the finished omni projects, which should be download.
